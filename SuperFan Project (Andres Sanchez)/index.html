			<div class="bio orange">Odell Cornelious Beckham Jr. (born November 5, 1992), also widely known as OBJ, is an American football wide receiver 
			for the Cleveland Browns of the National Football League (NFL). Born in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, 
			Beckham played college football at nearby Louisiana State University (LSU), and was drafted by the New York Giants 
			in the first round of the 2014 NFL Draft with the 12th overall pick. Since entering the NFL, Beckham has 
			been one of the most productive and popular players, but he has drawn media 
			scrutiny for his conduct on and off the playing field.</div>
